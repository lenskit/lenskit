  * Added <<<LenskitConfiguration>>> class and deprecated <<<LenskitRecommenderEngineFactory>>>.
    Use <<<LenskitRecommenderEngine.build()>>> to build an engine from a configuration.

  * Added <<<PreferenceDomainBuilder>>> to build preference domains.

  * <<<PreferenceDomain>>> now uses a precision of 0 to represent continuous scales (#issue(327));
    the value is still formally undefined behavior, but code which (incorrectly) depended on the
    precision when a domain does not have a precision may need to be corrected.

* Evaluator

  The evaluator has seen heavy refactoring and rewrite in 1.2.  Eval scripts are mostly compatible;
  these notes focus on user-visible differences.  Code that directly used the eval classes will
  likely need updates that are not described here.

  * For tasks (which replace commands), the eval config is available as the <<<evalConfig>>>
    property (rather than the old <<<config>>>).  <<<config>>> is still available as a top-level
    property on the script; it is also accessible as <<<eval.config>>>, with the new <<<eval>>>
    property that makes the script accessible by name.
