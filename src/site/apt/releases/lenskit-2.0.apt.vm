  * Remove many deprecated classes and methods, including algorithm-specific recommenders.

  * <<<RatingPredictor>>> no longer extends <<<ItemScorer>>>.

  * <<<Recommender>>>s are no longer <<<Closeable>>>, and do not need to be closed.  They can
    be left to be garbage collected.  To reflect this, <<<RecommenderEngine.open()>>> has been
    renamed <<<createRecommender()>>>.

  * The way DAOs work has been completely rewritten.  There is non longer a monolithic
    <<<DataAccessObject>>>, but several modular DAO instances.  Documentation on this is
    forthcoming.

  * Scorer, predictor, and recommender components now only take a user ID; the <<<UserHistory>>>-based
    methods have been removed.  The user event DAO should be fast & caching, so individual components
    can request the data they need directly.

  * Event and history interfaces have been moved out of <<<lenskit-api>>> into <<<lenskit-core>>>,
    in their corresponding packages.

  * Provider <<<get()>>> methods can now be annotated with <<<@Shareable>>> to indicate that the
    provider returns a shareable component.

  []

* Baseline Algorithms

  Baseline predictors have been restructured to implement <<<ItemScorer>>>; the old
  <<<BaselinePredictor>>> interface is gone.  Baseline scorers are qualified with
  <<<BaselineScorer>>>.

  * To configure a baseline, bind <<<ItemScorer>>> with the qualifier <<<BaselineScorer>>>.

  * To fall back to a baseline for missing scores, use either <<<SimpleRatingPredictor>>> (which
    includes fallback) or <<<FallbackItemScorer>>>, which takes two item scorers annotated with
    <<<PrimaryScorer>>> and <<<BaselineScorer>>>.  The primary scorer is consulted first, and the
    baseline used to fill in any scores the primary could not.

  * <<<ItemUserMeanPredictor>>> is gone.  Instead, the <<<UserMeanItemScorer>>> can use an arbitrary
    scorer as the base from which user offsets should be computed.  It qualifies this scorer
    dependency with <<<UserMeanBaseline>>>, which defaults to the global mean rating item scorer.
    Configure this to use <<<ItemMeanRatingItemScorer>>> to get a user-item personalized mean.

  * <<<PrimaryScorer>>> now allows unqualified matches, so dependencies qualified with it will be
    satisfied by an unqualified <<<ItemScorer>>> binding, if there is no qualified binding.

  []

* Data Structures

  * More <<<SparseVectors>>> methods now throw <<<IllegalArgumentException>>> on invalid keys,
    rather than being no-ops or returning <<<NaN>>>.

  * Sparse vectors and scored ids now have consistent channel behavior, with <<<TypedSymbol>>> being
    the the most general interface to channels.  Raw symbols reference <unboxed> side channels (raw
    doubles or vectors); they will be how most code interacts with channels, but are now conceptually
    a special case of side channels with an optimized implementation.

  * <<<long>>>-related collection utilities have been moved to <<<LongUtils>>>.

  * <<<LongSortedArraySet>>> should not be used directly; instead, use <<<LongUtils.packedSet>>>.

  * Removed <<<LongCursor>>>; it is no longer needed with the new DAOs.

  * Deprecated pointers. They will be removed, or only used internally to the data structure code,
    by LensKit 2.0.

  * For consistency, all data structures should be created using builders or static factory methods,
    not their constructors (see Effective Java).  Public data structure constructors have therefore
    been deprecated, and will be removed in LensKit 2.0.
